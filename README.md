# Root-Extractor

It helps us to find the roots of a quadratic equation with two unknowns, step by step, starting from 0 with a sensitivity value. It can be used as an alternative to the **Bi-section** and **Delta** method.

The program was prepared in the **GNU Octave** environment. I recommend running these files on Octave. The file has the extension **.m**
